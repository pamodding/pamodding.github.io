if u see anything about gear+ or resource packs or whatever, that was just some old stuff from years ago
you dont really need to worry about that check it out if u want tho
it was just my base on how to lay out this website since they are both modifications of games
its still up on https://gearplus.7m.pl/ but its really bad
caution: #FFFFFF background prepare ur eyes


if you want to see what im planning the PA website to look like in the future, you can find that at
https://pamodding.github.io/home/ !

thanks for being interested on my modding website i dont expect anyone to find this lol, tell me if u did
i would be interested on why :)
